## Background

The subject of this data analysis is a Hawaiian Tour Company in Maui, Hawaii. The data for this project was acquired through a family member who runs and operates the company. Due to the use of sensitive information, the csv files containing the data for this project have not been included. The company operates by managing and directing employees who operate as tour guides for an iconic tour called Road to Hana. This tour takes customers around the isolated eastern side of Maui, Hawaii, where they venture into the lives of native Hawaiians.

Both of the charts show the distribution of grades over all 5 classes. In "Number of Final Grades", it can be observed that the majority of students scored a B- or higher with the final score of B containing the most amount of students. In "Histogram of Final Grades with Kernel Density Estimation", a histogram shows the distribution of grades over the numerical score between 0-100%. The histogram also includes the Kernal Density Estimate(KDE) which peaks between a score of 80-90%. In this case, the KDE tells where the majority of students held their final grades. An interesting inflection point in the KDE lies right before the passing grade cutoff between 65-69%.

In this box plot it can be concluded that over time, the final grades of students improved every semester. This can be due to a couple of factors:
- Teacher's curriculum and quality improved over time.
- The syllabus of the course changed more favorably for students over time.
- Prerequisite classes better prepared students for sequential courses.
