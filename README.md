# Hawaii-Tour-Company
Data Analysis on a Hawaiian Tour Company using Python, SQL, Pandas, and Geopandas

## Background

The subject of this data analysis is a Hawaiian Tour Company in Maui, Hawaii. For the sake of anonymity, the company will be referred to as Hawaiian Tour Company for this data analysis. The data for this project was acquired through a family member who runs and operates the company. Due to the use of sensitive information, the csv files containing the data for this project have not been included. The company operates by managing and directing employees who operate as tour guides for an iconic tour called Road to Hana. This tour takes customers around the isolated eastern side of Maui, Hawaii, where they venture into the lives of native Hawaiians. The other revenue sources for this company consists of reselling tours for other islands/companies and private tours around the island. An important note throughout this data analysis is that ticket prices remain consist for all tours. This means that an increase in revenue directly correlates to an increase in the number of customers.

These two conclusions supplement a greater analysis further below.

## Revenue by Weekday, Month, Season

In this section, I wanted to examine which day of the week, month of the year, and season of the year generated the most revenue. This would provide the management of the Hawaiian Tour Company the ability to understand which days they can expect the most amount of customers. By doing so, the Hawaiian Tour Company can allocated more resources during the specific days, months, seasons. The Hawaiian Tour Company can hire more employees in anticipation for busy seasons or months. They can also plan when to purchase long term investments such new tour trucks as high demand can raise the price of these specialized vehicles.

In this chart, Mondays were found to be the busiest day of the week, followed by Wednesdays and Tuesdays. This can mean that customers prefer to book tours early in the week rather than the expected prediction of Saturdays and Sundays.

Through these two charts, the summer months of June, July, and August were found to be the busiest times of the year with a sudden drop in September. December also generates a peak in revenue during the year but is outshadowed by the summer months.

To summarize, Mondays followed by Wednesday and then Tuesdays during the month of July are the busiest times of the year. As such, the Hawaiian Tour Company can look for seasonal workers during the summer months to provide some relief to the demand of tours during this time. Other factors such as an increase in car washes of tour vans, mechanics, and office workers will be needed during these times.

- Teacher's curriculum and quality improved over time.
- The syllabus of the course changed more favorably for students over time.
- Prerequisite classes better prepared students for sequential courses.
